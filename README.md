TikTok users have the ability to submit reports that identify videos and comments that contain user claims. In a social media platform like TikTok, report a claim typically refers to the feature that allows users to report content that they believe violates the platform's community guidelines or terms of service. When a user reports a claim over a video, they are flagging the content for reviewing by the platform's content moderation team. The team then assess the reported content to determine if it indeed violates the guidelines, and if so, they may take actions such as removing the content, issuing a warning to the user who posted it, or even suspending or banning the user's account who posted the video. Reporting a claim is an important tool for maintaining a safe and respectful environment on social media platforms.

However, this process generates a large number of reports that are challenging to consider in a timely manner. Therefore, TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.
